  I've never thought<sub><a class = "red" href="https://www.naver.com" target="_blank">huh</a></sub> of becoming an artist for the first 22 years of my life, while applying for college, attending engineering, and working for a while. Of course, it would be false to say never, but I put down the passion that started to spark for a stable workplace and a normal life that everyone dreams of. Nevertheless, the passion that the flames began to burn once, was not suppressed just by pressing. I couldn't turn a blind eye to my burning passion with just a little inspiration, persuaded my parents and decided to go to an art school. Some people may think my choice is stupid, but I had a clear reason to come to SAIC.

  I tend to lag behind the theory of art more than others in school. That's because the period I studied in earnest was short, but it was also a different subject than other subjects<sup><a href="https://www.naver.com" target="_blank">huh</a></sup> I had studied so far. It still has the advantage of being able to see art from a slightly different perspective than other students, although it has not yet abandoned the general view of thinking computationally first. It's far from what we call lightning inspiration, but we're building theories, building knowledge, and building things that can be a source of inspiration. We build ideas through various experiments and experiences, not through ideas that come to mind at once.
